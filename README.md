# [42] First Internship

It's important to keep in mind that this video should be good, like really good. 42 says, and I quote:  

> *The state of your presentation, speech, and outfit
should be professional and the video-editing and -production should be
high quality (worthy of presenting)*

For me this says anything SFW and well, the way I present, talk and dress
should look professional. Nothing more, nothing less.
