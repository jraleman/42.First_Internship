## Results

During my internship period, I contributed to:

### Features

Issues and Results of those projects

#### Hooks

Hooks are React's...

- **useToggle**

I implemented to have a simple, yet common hook when
a toggling action is needed. I used it to be able
to toggle a modal.

- **useFetchData**

Because the app has about 42 restful api calls, we needed a way to reduce copy-paste code as much as possible. My boss guided me into creating this hook.

- **useSessionStorage**

This is another simple hook, but also very useful
when you need to save states (data) in a user session,
meaning that it will be persistent as long as he
doesn't logout or close the browser.

#### Components

A component in React is....

- **SearchBar**

Similar to AWS...

- **Modal Calendar**

A Modal ...

...

- **Class to Functional Components**

react started like this...

```js
// Example of first iteration of React.js
```

then like this...

```js
// Example of second iteration? (if it exists) of React.js
```

then this...

```js
// Class component based
```

and now...

```js
// Functional component
```

They are all equivalent!

Used `styled-components` to unify styles between components.
